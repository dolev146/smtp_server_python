# smtp server with pyhton
## sending email :)

Simple mail transfer protocol

- send email as a business
- send email not as a spam
- using the business domain you have :)

## Conclusions

- i tried to test both the idea of smtp server
- but i ended up liking a mail api better
- because it was easier to understands if a bug is happening and where it comes from 
- as appose to the smtp server that there are multiple factors involved


At the moment you can only send to verified emails so you can not do serious things in this software but it was really cool to get used to and understand how things work

at the moment the emails get inside the spam folder because the domain not authorized. :)
